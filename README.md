# 🏁 Competitive Programming Solutions

Welcome to my personal repository of solutions to competitive programming problems from platforms like:

- [Beecrowd](https://www.beecrowd.com.br/)
- [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)
- [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/)

I'm solving problems using **C++**, focusing on logic, algorithms, and preparation for programming contests and interviews.
